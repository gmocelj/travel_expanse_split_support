## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I add an expense?**
Open a trip, tap the "+" button, enter the amount, select who paid, choose participants, and pick a split method.

**How do I settle debts?**
Go to the Settlement tab within a trip to see who owes whom. Record payments as they happen to keep track.

**What's included in Premium?**
Premium unlocks unlimited trips and people, QR and OCR receipt scanning, analytics dashboard, and live exchange rates for multi-currency trips.

**How do I restore my purchase on a new device?**
Go to the subscription screen and tap "Restore Purchases".

**Is my data stored in the cloud?**
No. All your data is stored locally on your device. No account is required and no data leaves your device.

**How do I delete my data?**
Simply delete the app from your device. This permanently removes all trips, expenses, settlements, and preferences stored locally. There is no account or cloud backup to delete separately.

**My subscription isn't working — what do I do?**
First, try tapping "Restore Purchases" on the subscription screen. If the issue persists, contact Apple Support for billing and payment issues, as all purchases are processed by Apple. For anything else, reach out to us at [goran.mocelj@gmail.com](mailto:goran.mocelj@gmail.com).

**How do I get a refund?**
Refunds are handled by Apple. Please visit [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com) to request a refund for any App Store purchase.
